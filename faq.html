          <p> <strong>Q. Why is Cisco making both source and binary versions
          available?</strong><br />
          A: The source code is available so that an implementation of H.264
          is available for the community to use across any project, and to
          leverage the community to make the codec better for all. We have
          selected licensing terms that allow for this code to be used in
          commercial products as well as open source projects. In order for
          Cisco to be responsible for the MPEG LA licensing royalties for the
          module, Cisco must provide the packaging and distribution of this code
          in a binary module format (think of it like a plug-in, but not using
          the same APIs as existing plugins), in addition to several other
          constraints. This gives the community the best of all worlds - a team
          can choose to use the source code, in which case the team is
          responsible for paying all applicable license fees, or the team can
          use the binary module distributed by Cisco, in which case Cisco will
          cover the MPEG LA licensing fees. </p>

             <p> <strong>Q. Where can I learn more about this source and binary
            license?</strong><br /> A: There is a short video at <a
             href="http://vimeo.com/cullenfluffyjennings/openh264-ipr"
            target="_blank"
             >http://vimeo.com/cullenfluffyjennings/openh264-ipr</a>.</p>

          <p> <strong>Q: Is Cisco guaranteeing that it will pay other licensing
            fees for H.264, should additional patent holders assert claims in the
            future?<br />  </strong>A: Cisco is providing no such guarantee.  We are only
            covering the royalties that would apply to the binary module under
            MPEG LA's AVC/H.264 patent pool.</p>

          <p> <strong>Q: If I use the source code in my product, and then
          distribute that product on my own, will Cisco cover the MPEG LA
          licensing fees which I'd otherwise have to pay? </strong><br /> A:
          No. Cisco is only covering the licensing fees for its own binary
          module, and products or projects that utilize it must download it at
          the time the product or project is installed on the user's computer or
          device. Cisco will not be liable for any licensing fees incurred by
          other parties. </p>

          <p> <strong>Q.</strong> <strong>I'm a competitor of Cisco making a
          commercial product. Can I still take advantage of the H.264 module in
          my project? </strong><br /> A: Yes. If everyone has at least one video
          codec in common, our products will be able to communicate. That
          increases the number of other people everyone's products can talk
          to. The network effect helps everyone. </p>

          <p> <strong>Q. How will the open source project be governed?</strong><br />
            A: We will form a board consisting of leaders from the open source
            community as well as Unified Communication vendors. </p>

          <p> <strong>Q. What source code license is used?</strong><br />
            A: Two-Clause <a href="LICENSE.txt">BSD license</a>. </p>

          <p> <strong>Q. What platforms will you support?</strong><br />
            A: Our initial plan is to support Linux (x86 and ARM), Windows (XP
            forward), OSX, and Android. The governance board can decide to add
            additional platforms. As long as there are ports of the source code
            and automatic build scripts contributed as part of the open source,
            we do not see difficulties in adding additional platforms.
            </p>

          <p> <strong>Q. iOS is noticeably absent from the list of
            platforms. Why is that?</strong><br /> A: Unfortunately, iOS does
            not allow for applications to fetch and install modules from the
            Internet once that application has been installed on the
            device.  Recently, in iOS 8, Apple has provided an update to their 
            <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/releasenotes/General/WhatsNewIniOS/Articles/iOS8.html" target="_blank">Video Toolbox Framework</a> 
            that give developers direct access to H.264/AVC hardware encoding and decoding. <br /> </p>

           <p> <strong>Q. Where will the source code repository be hosted?</strong><br />
            A: It is at <a href="https://github.com/cisco/openh264"
            target="_blank">https://github.com/cisco/openh264</a>. </p>

          <p> <strong>Q. Which profiles of H.264 will be supported?</strong><br />
            A: The initial code has the baseline profile. We look forward to
            working with the open source community to add high profile and
            others. </p>

           <p> <strong> Q. What email list can developers use to discuss work on
           this project?</strong><br /> A: For right now, we are using the email
           list at openh264-dev@googlegroups.com - Subscribe at <a
            href="https://groups.google.com/d/forum/openh264-dev"
           >https://groups.google.com/d/forum/openh264-dev</a>.  </p>

<a name="binary"></a>

           <p> <strong>Q. What license will be used for the binary?</strong><br />
            A: Cisco provides the binary under the terms of a two-clause BSD license.  Additionally, the binary 
            is licensed under Ciscoâ€™s AVC/H.264 Patent Portfolio License from MPEG LA, at no cost to you, 
            provided the requirements and conditions listed in the AVC/H.264 Patent Portfolio sections are met. 
            Please see the full binary license text
            at <a href="BINARY_LICENSE.txt">http://www.openh264.org/BINARY_LICENSE.txt</a>. </p>
          
           <p> <strong>Q. My application doesn't have an end-user license agreement, so where must I 
           reproduce all of the binary license text? </strong><br />
            A: In the same location where any other licensing information is to be presented to the user.  
            Some examples include in a "description," "about" or "licenses" section or file.</p>
            
           <p> <strong>Q. How many back revisions of the binary will kept available for download? </strong><br />
            A: Initially, all back revisions of the binary will be available for download. Any exceptions or 
            changes to that plan in the future will be vetted with the community and governance board. </p>

           <p> <strong>Q. How do I have my application link to the binary module
            for downloading to users?</strong><br /> A: Please reference the
            RELEASES file in the main directory of the openh264 github
            repository at <a
             href="https://github.com/cisco/openh264/blob/master/RELEASES">
